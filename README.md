# Welcome to Uptime Industries
We are Fueled by our community. Here you can find all of our open source projects (including software, documentation, and more), to make enterprise easy and accessible for all.


Although the majority of our software is published here under open-source licenses, part of it is released under proprietary licenses. Please check the included `License.md` files for more details.


Maintaining the repositories can be thankless please consider supporting. Thank you in advance for your contribution.
